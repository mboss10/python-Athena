## Objectives of this repository
Detail and share how to use python scripts to connect to Amazon Athena, query the data and further leverage it in dataframes and other python scripts for data analysis.

## Context

Therefore I needed to learn how to connect to and query Amazon Athena through my python scripts.
More details below.
